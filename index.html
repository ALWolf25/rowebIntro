  Hi. My name is Andrei.
  I finished National College "Gheorghe Sincai", the high school with the sixth best admission average from Bucharest at the time.
  I am a student in forth year at Automatics and Computer Science faculty from University Politehnica of Bucharest and I expect to graduate this summer. I've accumulated knowledge about different programming languages (for example C, C++, Java, python, Haskell, Prolog, PL/SQL), design patterns and computer insides (for instance how do microprocessors work and what are the layers of the OSI model).
  I have taken extracurricular courses (twelve days of functional programming, offered by RosEdu - http://workshop.rosedu.org/2015/sesiuni/haskell) and I've participated in a summer school - http://3d.upb.ro/pub/3dpub2017.pdf, 9th edition in 2016 -.
  I appreciate the following sites: stackoverflow.com (being the best site to figure out most common functionality misunderstandings), wikipedia.org (or even wikia sites, collecting information about a subject into a centralized website), brilliant.org (having quizzes and introductions about the basics of multiple domains like economics and machine learning) and facebook.com (being the most popular social media, thus the best site for finding and communicating with others).
